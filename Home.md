## What is the Alexa Voice Service (AVS)?

The Alexa Voice Service (AVS) enables developers to integrate Alexa directly into their products, bringing the convenience of voice control to any connected device. AVS provides developers with a full suite of resources to quickly and easily build Alexa-enabled products, including APIs, hardware development kits, software development kits, and documentation.

## Overview of the AVS device SDK

The AVS Device SDK for C++ provides a C++ (11 or later) interface for the Alexa Voice Service (AVS) that allows developers to add intelligent voice control to connected products. It is modular and abstracted, providing components to handle discrete functionality such as speech capture, audio processing, and communications, with each component exposing APIs that you can use and customize for your integration. It also includes a sample app, which demonstrates interactions with the Alexa Voice Service (AVS).

## Authorization

The AVS Device SDK for C++ relies on Login With Amazon (LWA) to authorize your client to use AVS. The [SDK authorization guide](https://github.com/alexa/avs-device-sdk/wiki/Authorization#) provides instructions on how to authorize the sample app with AVS using LWA. For general information about authorization, view the [AVS authorization](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-voice-service/auth) page.
